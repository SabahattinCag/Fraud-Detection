# Fraud Detection Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my project: Fraud Detection!

In this project, I will tackle the challenging task of predicting whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. This is a crucial aspect of financial security, and machine learning can play a significant role in identifying and preventing fraudulent activities.

One of the key challenges I faced in this project is the absence of domain knowledge. Without knowing the underlying features and their significance, I had to focus solely on the numerical values and their relationships. Additionally, the class imbalance in the target variable presented another obstacle. The minority class, representing fraudulent transactions, was significantly less prevalent than the majority class, non-fraudulent transactions.

To address these challenges, I implemented various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network. I also employed Unbalanced Data Techniques to improve the performance of the models on the minority class. Additionally, I utilized visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to effectively represent the data and model performances.

Another crucial aspect of this project was data drift and model drift monitoring. To ensure the ongoing effectiveness of my model, I employed Deepchecks, a leading tool for validating and testing machine learning models and data. Deepchecks enabled me to perform Data Integrity, Train-Test Validation, and Model Evaluation checks.

Finally, I deployed my model using Streamlit API, creating a web application for real-time fraud detection. This application provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions on new credit card transactions.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
   * Examine frequency distributions of variables
   * Identify variable correlations and explore multicollinearity
   * Visualize the distribution of the target variable's classes over other variables
   * Handle missing values and outliers

2. **Model Building and Evaluation:**
   * Start with Logistic Regression and evaluate model performance
   * Apply Unbalanced Data Techniques to enhance model performance
   * Experiment with various algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network
   * Compare the performance of different models

3. **Model Deployment:**
   * Utilize Streamlit API to build a web application for fraud detection
   * Deploy the model to the Streamlit application
   * Test the deployed model on new transactions

## Deepchecks Introduction

Deepchecks is a powerful tool for validating and testing machine learning models and data. It enables you to perform various checks, including:

* Data Integrity: Verify data types, missing values, and data quality
* Train-Test Validation: Assess the stability of the model across different training and testing sets
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics

By incorporating Deepchecks into my workflow, I ensured the reliability and robustness of my model.

## Conclusion

This Fraud Detection Project provided me with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of applying machine learning to real-world problems. The ability to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in financial transactions has significant implications for safeguarding consumer data and financial systems. I am confident that the skills and knowledge gained from this project will be instrumental in my future endeavors in machine learning and data science.
